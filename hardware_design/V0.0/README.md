</p>

## [V0.4](V0.4)
### 1. Added solar cells and power management systems. Currently only power sharing. 
### 2. Working data logger. 
### 3. Has a real-time clock in hardware, but not always needed in software. 
### 4. Geophone and accelerometer working on on the the same code. 
### 5. Code can detect when its in free-fall using the accelerometer, and sends an interrupt signal to the microcontroller. 
### 6. Enviromental sensor works. This is inside the case, but will be for atmospheric testing once the case is re-designed. 
### 7. Conductivity sensor is working. 
### 8. Temperature probe in the spike not installed yet.
