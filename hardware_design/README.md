# Hardware Designs

## V0.1
1. Initial testing.
1. Designed a PCB.
1. Includes CAD Files.
1. Includes PCB Files.

## V0.2
1. A better version.


## V0.3
1. Working Geophone.
1. Working conductivity sensor.
1. Data logging.
1. Environmental Sensor (BME 280).
1. Accelerometer on hardware. 

## V0.4
1. Added solar cells and power management systems. Currently only power sharing. 
1. Working data logger. 
1. Has a real-time clock in hardware, but not always needed in software. 
1. Geophone and accelerometer working on on the the same code. 
1. Code can detect when its in free-fall using the accelerometer, and sends an interrupt signal to the microcontroller. 
1. Enviromental senor works. This is inside the case, but will be for atmospheric testing once the case is re-designed. 


# Long term goals

## V1.0 Sensor node
1. A sensor node that collects data and saves it to local memory.
1. Lasts for over a week.

## V2.0 Sensor node in a network
1. Can communicate and pass data between nodes.
1. Communication protocol for passing information developed.
1. Build a way-station to collect data from a network of sensors and communicate to the cloud. 

## V3.0 Autonomous Sensor node in network with edge computing
1. Has edge-computing capabilities. 
1. Can do Soil classification, fault detection, etc.
