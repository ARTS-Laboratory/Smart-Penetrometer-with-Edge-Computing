## V0.1
1. Initial testing.
1. Designed a PCB.
1. Includes CAD Files.
1. Includes PCB Files.

## V0.2
1. A better version.


## V0.3
1. Working Geophone.
1. Working conductivity sensor.
1. Data logging.
1. Environmental Sensor (BME 280).
1. Accelerometer on hardware. 

## V0.4
1. Added solar cells and power management systems. Currently only power sharing. 
1. Working data logger. 
1. Has a real-time clock in hardware, but not always needed in software. 
1. Geophone and accelerometer working on on the the same code. 
1. Code can detect when its in free-fall using the accelerometer, and sends an interrupt signal to the microcontroller. 
1. Enviromental senor works. This is inside the case, but will be for atmospheric testing once the case is re-designed. 
1. Conductivity sensor is working. 
1. Temperature probe in the spike not installed yet.
