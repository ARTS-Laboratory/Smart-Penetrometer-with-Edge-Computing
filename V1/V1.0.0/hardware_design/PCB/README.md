## PCB
1. Designed symbol and footprint for DW01 battery protection IC.
2. Designed symbol and footprint for FS8205A dual channel MOSFET IC.
3. Updated schematic and PCB to include DW01 and FS8205A ICs with accompanying resistors and capacitors.
4. New design will protect LiPo battery from overdischarge due to low voltage.
